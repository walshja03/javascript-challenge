# JavaScript Data Read and Filter

For this assignment we were provided a starter html page that had some styling and header photos included. 

The goal of this was to read in a ufo sighting data file and dynamically generate a table that would include the column headers from the file as well as the data.  After doing so the next task was to create several filters that a user could interact with which would change the data displayed in the table.  After completing the base task I enhanced the filters so that they would change to show appropriate options based on a users selection.  For instance if a user selects US as the country the Canadian options will no longer be in the state selection list.  After getting the filters to function in that manner for a better user interaction experience I added a message for users if they chose a combination of filters that didn't return any results such as a date and location that didn't have a siting.  In this situation the table was made to reset and show all of the results as well as re-populate all of the filter options. Lastly, some updates were made to the html and CSS to make the page more aesthetically pleasing.

I've left the original assignment and starter code in the instructions folder so you can see what was provided.
